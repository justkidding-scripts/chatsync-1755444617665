**User Request:** Deling over flere beskeder: Hvis du sender uddrag i flere beskeder, kan du nummerere dem ("Del 1 af 5", "Del 2 af 5" osv.) for at holde orden.

i want it to be a program that each morning i enter chatgpt it asks if i want to copy yesterdays conversations (all of them) 
but also the ability to import whole json from chatexport history of all chats, just make them import in pieces if its too long, set up for max amount.

i also want a trial, to to speak.
i want to program to ask me to run a quick trial, to see if it works

**Response Summary:** Enhanced the ChatGPT Conversation Logger with three major new features:

## Features Implemented:

### 1. Morning Prompt System
- **Automatic Detection**: Checks for yesterday's conversations on app load
- **Smart Prompting**: Only shows prompt if yesterday had conversations and user hasn't been prompted today
- **One-Click Copy**: Copy all of yesterday's conversations to today with a single button
- **Skip Option**: User can dismiss the prompt for the day
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled in settings
- **Persistent State**: Remembers if user was already prompted today

### 2. ChatGPT JSON Import with Chunking
- **Multiple Format Support**: Handles both new ChatGPT mapping format and legacy message format
- **Chunked Processing**: Processes large imports in configurable chunks (1-50 conversations per batch)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator during import
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically detects conversation structure and extracts user/assistant pairs
- **Date Organization**: Imports conversations to their original dates based on create_time
- **UI Integration**: Beautiful import dialog with file selection and progress display
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for malformed JSON files

### 3. Trial/Test Mode
- **OpenAI Connectivity Test**: Sends test prompt to verify API key and connection
- **GitHub Upload Test**: Tests GitHub integration if configured
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/failure indicators with checkmarks and X marks
- **Configuration Validation**: Helps users troubleshoot setup issues
- **Non-destructive**: Tests don't affect regular conversation history

## Technical Implementation:
- **Enhanced Config Interface**: Added maxChunkSize and morningPromptEnabled to configuration
- **New State Management**: Added multiple state variables for import progress, morning prompt display, and trial mode
- **Advanced Parsing Logic**: Implemented extractChatEntries function to handle complex ChatGPT export formats
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Added proper interfaces for ImportedChat structure
- **UI Components**: Integrated new features seamlessly into existing design with import dialogs and morning prompt alerts
- **Local Storage Integration**: Smart handling of date-based conversation storage and prompt tracking

## User Experience Enhancements:
- **Morning Workflow**: Streamlined daily workflow with automatic conversation copying
- **Import Workflow**: Easy import of existing ChatGPT history with progress feedback
- **Testing Workflow**: Quick verification that everything works before regular use
- **Settings Integration**: All new features configurable through the settings dialog

The application now provides a complete solution for ChatGPT conversation management with automated daily workflows, historical data import capabilities, and comprehensive testing functionality.

**Files Modified:**
- app/page.tsx (added morning prompt system, JSON import functionality, trial mode, enhanced UI components)
- README.md (updated documentation with new features and usage instructions)

## [usr-1755441431732]
**User Request:** Below is a suggested plan for building an app that captures your ChatGPT conversations locally and optionally uploads them to GitHub each day. The approach is purely externalChatGPT itself cannot be configured to autoupload or "remember" data beyond a single session, so all automation happens in your own application.

1. Architecture (three parts)
Data Capture Module

Sends prompts/responses through OpenAI's API so every message is already logged locally.

Stores each day's chat in a simple JSON file (e.g., 2024-06-11.json).

GitHub Upload Module

Uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) to push the daily JSON file into a GitHub repository.

You can run it as a scheduled job (cron or Windows Task Scheduler) at, say, 22:00 every night.

GUI Module

Optional interface (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt) to view/confirm what's saved and trigger uploads manually if you prefer.

2. Environment variables (set them outside ChatGPT)
Variable	Purpose
OPENAI_API_KEY	Your OpenAI API key
GITHUB_TOKEN	GitHub PAT with repo permissions
GITHUB_REPO	e.g., "username/chat-history"
UPLOAD_TIME	e.g., "22:00" (used by scheduler)
macOS/Linux (bash):

export OPENAI_API_KEY="din_openai_n�gle"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="din_github_pat"
export GITHUB_REPO="brugernavn/chat-history"
export UPLOAD_TIME="22:00"
Windows (PowerShell):

setx OPENAI_API_KEY "din_openai_n�gle"
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "din_github_pat"
setx GITHUB_REPO "brugernavn/chat-history"
setx UPLOAD_TIME "22:00"
After setting them, open a new terminal so your script can read the variables.

3. Minimal Python modules
chat_capture.py
import os, datetime, json
from openai import OpenAI  # pip install openai

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

def send_prompt(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    text = resp.choices[0].message.content
    return text

def save_log(prompt, answer):
    today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    log_file = f"logs/{today}.json"
    entry = {"prompt": prompt, "answer": answer}
    os.makedirs("logs", exist_ok=True)
    data = []
    if os.path.exists(log_file):
        with open(log_file) as f: data = json.load(f)
    data.append(entry)
    with open(log_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = input("Skriv din prompt: ")
    a = send_prompt(p)
    save_log(p, a)
    print("Svar:", a)
github_upload.py
import os, datetime
from github import Github  # pip install PyGithub

def upload_today():
    repo_name = os.getenv("GITHUB_REPO")
    token = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
    today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    path = f"logs/{today}.json"

    if not os.path.exists(path):
        print("Ingen log i dag")
        return

    g = Github(token)
    repo = g.get_repo(repo_name)
    with open(path) as f:
        content = f.read()
    repo.create_file(f"logs/{today}.json", f"Add log {today}", content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_today()
gui_main.py
import tkinter as tk
import subprocess, threading
from chat_capture import send_prompt, save_log

def send():
    prompt = entry.get()
    answer = send_prompt(prompt)
    save_log(prompt, answer)
    output.insert(tk.END, f"You: {prompt}\nGPT: {answer}\n\n")

def upload():
    threading.Thread(target=lambda: subprocess.run(["python", "github_upload.py"])).start()

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Chat log saver")

entry = tk.Entry(root, width=60)
entry.pack()
tk.Button(root, text="Send", command=send).pack()
tk.Button(root, text="Upload to GitHub", command=upload).pack()

output = tk.Text(root, width=70, height=20)
output.pack()

root.mainloop()
4. Scheduling the nightly upload
Linux/macOS (cron):

crontab -e
# Add:
0 22 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/github_upload.py
Windows (Task Scheduler):

Create a basic task � "Daily" � time: 22:00

Action: "Start a program" � python with argument C:\path\to\github_upload.py

5. Notes on "remembering"
The official ChatGPT web interface doesn't allow automatic saving or re-uploading; all memory management must be external, as above.

Each conversation you have via the API can be logged and re-fed later if you want "memory."

With these pieces, you can create a simple desktop app that logs all your prompts/responses, provides a small GUI for interaction, and automatically commits the logs to GitHub every evening.

built i gui for this that shows the automation, and durring instalttion asks for whatever info it needs, also auto installs other third party software needed
