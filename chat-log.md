## [usr-1755441431732]
**User Request:** Below is a suggested plan for building an app that captures your ChatGPT conversations locally and optionally uploads them to GitHub each day. The approach is purely externalChatGPT itself cannot be configured to autoupload or "remember" data beyond a single session, so all automation happens in your own application.

1. Architecture (three parts)
Data Capture Module

Sends prompts/responses through OpenAI's API so every message is already logged locally.

Stores each day's chat in a simple JSON file (e.g., 2024-06-11.json).

GitHub Upload Module

Uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) to push the daily JSON file into a GitHub repository.

You can run it as a scheduled job (cron or Windows Task Scheduler) at, say, 22:00 every night.

GUI Module

Optional interface (e.g., Tkinter or PyQt) to view/confirm what's saved and trigger uploads manually if you prefer.

2. Environment variables (set them outside ChatGPT)
Variable	Purpose
OPENAI_API_KEY	Your OpenAI API key
GITHUB_TOKEN	GitHub PAT with repo permissions
GITHUB_REPO	e.g., "username/chat-history"
UPLOAD_TIME	e.g., "22:00" (used by scheduler)
macOS/Linux (bash):

export OPENAI_API_KEY="din_openai_nÔøΩgle"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="din_github_pat"
export GITHUB_REPO="brugernavn/chat-history"
export UPLOAD_TIME="22:00"
Windows (PowerShell):

setx OPENAI_API_KEY "din_openai_nÔøΩgle"
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "din_github_pat"
setx GITHUB_REPO "brugernavn/chat-history"
setx UPLOAD_TIME "22:00"
After setting them, open a new terminal so your script can read the variables.

3. Minimal Python modules
chat_capture.py
import os, datetime, json
from openai import OpenAI  # pip install openai

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

def send_prompt(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    text = resp.choices[0].message.content
    return text

def save_log(prompt, answer):
    today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    log_file = f"logs/{today}.json"
    entry = {"prompt": prompt, "answer": answer}
    os.makedirs("logs", exist_ok=True)
    data = []
    if os.path.exists(log_file):
        with open(log_file) as f: data = json.load(f)
    data.append(entry)
    with open(log_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = input("Skriv din prompt: ")
    a = send_prompt(p)
    save_log(p, a)
    print("Svar:", a)
github_upload.py
import os, datetime
from github import Github  # pip install PyGithub

def upload_today():
    repo_name = os.getenv("GITHUB_REPO")
    token = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
    today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    path = f"logs/{today}.json"

    if not os.path.exists(path):
        print("Ingen log i dag")
        return

    g = Github(token)
    repo = g.get_repo(repo_name)
    with open(path) as f:
        content = f.read()
    repo.create_file(f"logs/{today}.json", f"Add log {today}", content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_today()
gui_main.py
import tkinter as tk
import subprocess, threading
from chat_capture import send_prompt, save_log

def send():
    prompt = entry.get()
    answer = send_prompt(prompt)
    save_log(prompt, answer)
    output.insert(tk.END, f"You: {prompt}\nGPT: {answer}\n\n")

def upload():
    threading.Thread(target=lambda: subprocess.run(["python", "github_upload.py"])).start()

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Chat log saver")

entry = tk.Entry(root, width=60)
entry.pack()
tk.Button(root, text="Send", command=send).pack()
tk.Button(root, text="Upload to GitHub", command=upload).pack()

output = tk.Text(root, width=70, height=20)
output.pack()

root.mainloop()
4. Scheduling the nightly upload
Linux/macOS (cron):

crontab -e
# Add:
0 22 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/github_upload.py
Windows (Task Scheduler):

Create a basic task ÔøΩ "Daily" ÔøΩ time: 22:00

Action: "Start a program" ÔøΩ python with argument C:\path\to\github_upload.py

5. Notes on "remembering"
The official ChatGPT web interface doesn't allow automatic saving or re-uploading; all memory management must be external, as above.

Each conversation you have via the API can be logged and re-fed later if you want "memory."

With these pieces, you can create a simple desktop app that logs all your prompts/responses, provides a small GUI for interaction, and automatically commits the logs to GitHub every evening.

built i gui for this that shows the automation, and durring instalttion asks for whatever info it needs, also auto installs other third party software needed
