### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**‚ùå "Invalid API Key" Error**
- **Cause**: Incorrect or expired OpenAI API key
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify your API key starts with "sk-"
  2. Check your OpenAI account billing and usage limits
  3. Generate a new API key if needed
  4. Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account

**‚ùå GitHub Upload Fails**
- **Cause**: Incorrect GitHub token or repository settings
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify your token starts with "ghp_"
  2. Check the repository format is "username/repo-name"
  3. Ensure the repository exists
  4. Verify your token has "repo" scope permissions
  5. Check if the repository is private and your token has access

**‚ùå Import Not Working**
- **Cause**: Invalid JSON file or browser memory issues
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure you're using a ChatGPT export file
  2. Try reducing chunk size to 5-10 for large files
  3. Check the JSON file isn't corrupted
  4. Close other browser tabs to free memory

**‚ùå Conversations Disappeared**
- **Cause**: Looking at wrong date or browser data cleared
- **Solution**:
  1. Check you're viewing the correct date
  2. Use export feature regularly for backups
  3. Check if browser storage was cleared
  4. Import from GitHub backup if available

**‚ùå Scheduler Not Working**
- **Cause**: Browser tab closed or system sleeping
- **Solution**:
  1. Keep the browser tab open at scheduled time
  2. Check scheduler toggle is enabled
  3. Verify upload time is set correctly
  4. Consider manual uploads as backup

#### Performance Tips
